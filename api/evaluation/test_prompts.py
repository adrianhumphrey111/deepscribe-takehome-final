                Patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, initially diagnosed in 2019. She underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with AC-T protocol, followed by left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Pathology showed ypT2N1M0, ER positive (95%), PR positive (85%), HER2 negative. She completed adjuvant radiation therapy and has been on tamoxifen since surgery. 
                
                She presents today with new onset of back pain and recent imaging showing multiple bone lesions consistent with metastatic disease. Biopsy of L3 lesion confirmed metastatic breast adenocarcinoma, maintaining ER/PR positive, HER2 negative profile. She lives in Seattle, Washington with her husband and works as a teacher.
                
                Current medications include tamoxifen 20mg daily, calcium carbonate, and vitamin D. She has no known drug allergies. Family history is significant for breast cancer in her maternal aunt. She is interested in exploring clinical trial options for her metastatic disease.

EGFR wild-type, ALK negative, PD-L1 expression 65%. She completed concurrent chemoradiation with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and durvalumab maintenance therapy. 
                
                Past medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with 40-pack-year smoking history (quit 1 year ago), hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. She had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago with stent placement and is on dual antiplatelet therapy.
                
                Current medications include durvalumab infusions every 4 weeks, metformin 1000mg twice daily, lisinopril 10mg daily, metoprolol 50mg twice daily, atorvastatin 40mg daily, aspirin 81mg daily, clopidogrel 75mg daily, tiotropium inhaler daily, and albuterol as needed. 
                
                She lives in Phoenix, Arizona with her retired husband. They have adult children who live nearby and are very supportive. She's a retired nurse and is well-informed about her conditions. Recent scans show stable disease but she's interested in clinical trial options if her cancer progresses.
                
                She has a penicillin allergy causing hives. Recent labs show well-controlled diabetes (HbA1c 6.8%) and adequate renal function (creatinine 1.1). ECOG performance status is 1. She walks 30 minutes daily and maintains good nutritional status.
                
                This transcript contains over 2000 words when expanded with additional detail about her treatment history, family background, and detailed discussion of her various medical conditions and their management. Her oncologist discussed the possibility of immunotherapy trials, targeted therapy options based on future molecular profiling, and combination treatment approaches. The patient expressed strong interest in research participation and has good social support for trial logistics.
